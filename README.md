This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar).

If you regularly work in Vue 2 workspaces, disable the Volar extension globally. Then, in this workspace, right-click on the Vetur extension in the sidebar and select `Disable (Workspace)`. Then right-click on the Volar extension and select `Enable (Workspace)`.

You will also need to enable TypeScript [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) by doing the following:

- Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
- Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
- Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
